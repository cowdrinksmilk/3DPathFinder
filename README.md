# 3DPathFinder
This project uses A* search to solve an orienteering challenge on a simulated terrain map. It finds the fastest path through control points by factoring in terrain types and elevation data. The output is a visualized map with the path drawn and total distance printed, combining pathfinding and image analysis.
